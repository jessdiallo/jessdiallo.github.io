## Optimizing control of a freshwater invader in time and space
*Manuscript under review*

Bayesian hierarchical modeling was used to estimate demographic parameters with existing removal data of green sunfish (*Lepomis cyanellus*) in intermittent streams of the Bill Williams River in Arizona, USA. Resulting probability of eradication was 0.39 for two removal programs conducted years apart but following the same protocol. Alternative management strategies were then simulated, revealing the importance of continued sampling after zero fish are captured and the increased efficiency of dynamic management.

## Fish invaders cause a lifetime of trophic change in native desert fishes
*Manuscript in preparation*

Invasive fishes modify the structure and function of riverine food webs through their presence and competitive and predatory interactions with native fishes. The degree of trophic plasticity of native fishes at different life stages in response to invaders is unknown. This research provides insight into life-long trends in dietary isotope values using fish eye lenses that grow incrementally and are comprised of metabolically inert, proteinaceous tissue. The findings demonstrate significant shifts in 13C/12C and 15N/14N throughout an individualâ€™s lifetime that vary ontogenetically and differ for native species in native-only versus mixed native-invasive fish assemblages. Trophic level generally increases throughout ontogeny, with native fishes in mixed assemblages displaced to a lower trophic position compared to native-only. Native fish conservation should consider how invasive fishes impact native fishes at multiple life stages, with implications for individual growth and population persistence.

Otoliths from captured fish were used to age the fish and link eye lens layers to fish age and points in time. This is possible using species-specific relationships between fish length and eye lens diameter, fish length and otolith diameter, as well as individual fish measurements of growth (age vs. fish length).

## Leveraging PIT tag data to better understand northern pikeminnow movement in the Columbia River Basin

Northern pikeminnow are a native predator of juvenile salmonids in the Columbia River Basin. Since 1991, the Northern Pikeminnow Management Program has targetted northern pikeminnow for harvest using a sport reward fishery. The goal of the program is to shift the size distribution to smaller individuals that consume fewer juvenile salmonids, thereby reducing predation. One of the program's metrics of success is exploitation rate, which is calculated through tagging and releasing northern pikeminnow. Since 2003, northern pikeminnow have been PIT tagged

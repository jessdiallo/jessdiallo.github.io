# Optimizing control of a freshwater invader in time and space

Bayesian hierarchical modeling was used to estimate demographic parameters with existing removal data of green sunfish (*Lepomis cyanellus*) in intermittent streams of the Bill Williams River in Arizona, USA. Resulting probability of eradication was 0.39 for two removal programs conducted years apart but following the same protocol. Alternative management strategies were then simulated, revealing the importance of continued sampling after zero fish are caught and the increased efficiency of dynamic management.

    "text": "Optimizing control of a freshwater invader in time and space\nManuscript in press (Ecological Applications)\nCo-authors: Sarah Converse1, Matt Chmiel2, Andy Stites2, Julian Olden1\n1: University of Washington\n2: Arizona Game and Fish Department\nThe continued and growing impacts of invasive freshwater fishes has prompted many natural resource agencies to implement control programs with the goal of population suppression or eradication. Mechanical removal is the favored control method with respect to cost and reduced likelihood of collateral damage, yet its past success in achieving species management goals varies substantially. Control programs that optimally allocate removal effort across space and time offer promise for improving invasive species suppression or eradication, especially given the limited resources available to these programs. Here we leveraged two intensive fish eradication programs for green sunfish (Lepomis cyanellus) in intermittent streams of the Bill Williams River in Arizona, USA, to explore alternative management strategies involving variable allocation of removal effort in time and space and compare static versus dynamic decision rules to guide actions. We used Bayesian hierarchical modeling to estimate demographic parameters using existing removal data. We show strong evidence that both removal programs led to successful eradication, with 0.39 probability of eradication (i.e., &lt;2 individuals remaining) in McGee Wash and East Ash Creek. Alternative management strategies were then simulated, revealing the importance of continued sampling after zero fish are captured and the increased efficiency of dynamic management. Simulated alternative management strategies revealed that population suppression could be achieved with fewer locations sampled via dynamic management based on catch rate, compared to randomly sampled locations. High removal frequency and program duration, including continued collections even after no fish were previously captured, contributed to eradication success.\n Map of tributaries within Trout Creek, AZ watershed where the Arizona Game and Fish Department (AZGFD) conducted green sunfish removals.

The degree of trophic plasticity of native fishes at different life stages in response to invaders is unknown. This research provides insight into life-long trends in dietary isotope values using fish eye lenses that grow incrementally and are comprised of metabolically inert, proteinaceous tissue. The findings demonstrate significant shifts in 13C/12C and 15N/14N throughout an individual’s lifetime that vary ontogenetically and differ for native species in native-only versus mixed native-invasive fish assemblages. Trophic level generally increases throughout ontogeny, with native fishes in mixed assemblages displaced to a lower trophic position compared to native-only. Native fish conservation should consider how invasive fishes impact native fishes at multiple life stages, with implications for individual growth and population persistence.\n Jess using backpack electrofishing to capture fish in Burro Creek, Arizona during April, 2021 (top left).

Eye lens layers are plotted as individual points from the core (1) to the outer layer (8) (bottom right)\nOtoliths from captured fish were used to age the fish and link eye lens layers to fish age and points in time. This is possible using species-specific relationships between fish length and eye lens diameter, fish length and otolith diameter, as well as individual fish measurements of growth (age vs. fish length).\n Roundtail chub lapillar otoliths (top left), green sunfish sagittal otoliths (bottom left), roundtail chub polished lapillar otoliths (top and bottom right).

The Northern Pikeminnow Management Program (NPMP) is a targeted harvest program, comprised primarily of a sport reward fishery, that has been operating in the Columbia and Lower Snake Rivers since 1991. As a result of this sport reward fishery, over 5.5 million piscivorous (≥ 200mm FL) northern pikeminnow have been harvested for cash rewards. Each year data are collected to monitor and evaluate the program. Northern pikeminnow have been PIT tagged through the NPMP since 2003 to calculate the program’s exploitation rate, with the goal of reducing the population by 10-20%. The model used assumes closed populations separated by dams and leads to an estimated annual reduction in predation. After being tagged, most northern pikeminnow are never recaptured, but their movement is passively tracked by PIT tag antennas. We combined data from the Columbia Basin PIT Tag Information System (PTAGIS) database with NPMP tagging and harvest data. Initial results reveal that individuals traveled as far as 968 km. Nearly 13% of northern pikeminnow harvested through the NPMP were captured in different reservoirs (or river sections separated by dams) than where they were initially tagged. Understanding northern pikeminnow movement will inform the exploitation rate calculation as one of the key measures of NPMP success. As the NPMP evolves over time, information on northern pikeminnow movement may also inform future management strategies.\n\nNorthern pikeminnow (photo credit: Fernando Lessa)\n\nBarplot displaying the detection types for 5967 northern pikeminnow subsequently detected after being tagged through the Northern Pikeminnow Management Program.\n\nTop figure is a chord diagram displaying the movement of PIT-tagged northern pikeminnow across dams within the bounds of the Northern Pikeminnow Management Program. Each number represents a single fish and the furthest they were detected traveling. Arrows indicate movement between adjacent reaches with the thickness proportional to the number of fish. Shaded areas without arrows represent fish that were only detected in their tagged reach. Numbered labels 1-9 identify river reaches or reservoirs separated by dams (as shown in the map below)."
